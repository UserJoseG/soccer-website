  <hr>
  <p>The Game me and my teamates played was a very close game and during that game one of my teamates got hurt But we still won. My championship game was fun because we had won but 
    my team kinda felt bad. After the game we went crazy because this are first championship game that we had wpn our coach was happy. We all went to the locker room and went crazy we even 
  threw stuff at each other that is one of the nights i will never forget.</p>
